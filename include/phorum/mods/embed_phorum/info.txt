title: Embed Phorum
desc: This module implements functionality for creating an embedded version of Phorum. Embedded means that Phorum will be the slave of a master system. The master system is responsible for feeding the Phorum system with user data and for processing page elements that are produced by Phorum. Since Phorum is a slave application in this setup, things like signup, authentication and settings are no longer handled by Phorum.
