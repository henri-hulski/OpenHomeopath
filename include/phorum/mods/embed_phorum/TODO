Things that have to or can be done for the embed_phorum module:

- Documentation

- Use session for auth storage and the image cookie hack if no session
  is available.

- Look what phorum settings we should set fixed from the code.

- Add control panel to mambo component to configure where phorum is installed.

- Find a solution for base-href problems (embedded, we are not running
  at the location that Phorum expects and unless a base href code can 
  be used in the master application, we have no option of telling the
  browser where to look for Phorum's files in case relative links are
  used). A first attempt (which is working pretty good) for fixing 
  relative URLs in the Phorum output is already put in the 
  PhorumConnectorBase class. See the comments in the connector for
  more info.

- Extend syncuser() so that username changes are allowed. Lots of master
  systems will allow for changing usernames. At this moment, changing the
  username will result in a nasty (though meant-to-be ;-) error message.

- When forcing a template to use from the get_template() connector method, 
  things can go wrong when changing settings from the user's control center. 
  If the user has another template than the fixed, it will get loaded.
  Seems to have to do something with fixed display settings or not.
  I'll have to find out what exactly is the bug here.

- Maybe split off the automatic login code into a separate module. That is
  a feature that is often requested as a separate feature in the support
  forums.
