 Installation and configuration

   1. Create a MySQL database and a user who has all rights for the database.
   2. Edit the file "openhomeopath/include/classes/db/config_db.php" by providing the name of the MySQL database, the username and his password.
      Also you can choose the database driver: "mysqli" or "mysql".
      Protect the file "config_db.php" on the server against unauthorized read and write access (e.g. with chmod 600),
      because the password is saved in plain text. Please note, that the server still needs read access.
   3. Upload the folder "openhomeopath" to your webserver.
   4. Call "http://your.webaddress.com/openhomeopath/install/install_db.php"
      on your server with the browser and import the data to the database.
   5. Now you can call "http://your.webaddress.com/openhomeopath/index.php" in your browser and here we are.
   6. The default user with administration rights is "admin".
      The default password: "admin". You should change the password after.
